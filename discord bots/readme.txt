This is the a discord bot i have created which has the following features:-

1)showing commands list 
2)giving a brief about itself
3)appending the discord username to the database
4)sending a basic message
5)telling if its online or not
6)playing a game of rock paper scrissors
7)playing a game of roll the dice
8)showing the scrore player has earned from the games he had played

at the end of the code there is a bot token which one should change by making his own bot and generating a token and then copying 
and pasting it in the quotes as this token number belongs to my personal bot and has been changed before uploading the code.
